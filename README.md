# 100 Days of Python
My journey through the "100 Days of Code - Python Bootcamp" by Angela Yu.

## Projects
- **Day 01: Band Name Generator**  
  - Description: A simple Python script that generates a band name using user inputs (city and pet name).  
  - File: [band_name_generator.py](Day01-BandNameGenerator/band_name_generator.py)
  - Sample Output:  
    Input: City = "Delhi", Pet = "Tommy"  
    Output: "Delhi Tommy"
- **Day 02: Tip Calculator**  
  - Description: A Python script to calculate the total bill with tip and split it among people.  
  - File: [tip_calculator.py](Day02_TipCalculator/tip_calculator.py)  
  - Sample Output:  
    Input: Bill = $100, Tip = 10%, People = 4  
    Output: "Each person should pay: $27.50"
- **Day 03: Treasure Island**
  - **Description**: A text-based adventure game where the player makes choices to find the treasure using nested if-else statements.
  - **File**: [treasure_island.py](Day03_TreasureIsland/treasure_island.py)
  - **Sample Output**:
    - Input: The player chooses "left" or "right", "swim" or "wait", etc.
    - Output: "You found the treasure! You Win!" or "Game Over."
- **Day 04: Rock Paper Scissors**
  - **Description**: A text-based game where the player competes against the computer in a classic Rock Paper Scissors match using random selection and conditionals.
  - **File**: [rock_paper_scissors.py](Day04_RockPaperScissors/rock_paper_scissors.py)
  - **Sample Output**:
    - Input: Player chooses "Rock"
    - Output: "Computer chose Scissors. You Win!" or "Computer chose Paper. You Lose!"
- **Day 5: Password Generator**
  - **Description**: A program that generates a random password using loops and basic randomization techniques.
  - **File**: [password_generator.py](Day05_PasswordGenerator/password_generator.py)
  - **Sample Output**:
    - Input: User specifies the desired length, count of letters, symbols and numbers in their password (e.g., 8 characters)
    - Output: "Your password is: s2t#u1v*"
- **Day 6: Escaping the Maze (Reeborg’s World)**
- **Description**: A program that helps Reeborg, a virtual robot, escape a maze in Reeborg’s World using loops and conditional logic to navigate obstacles.
- **File**: [escaping_the_maze.py](Day06_EscapingTheMaze/escaping_the_maze.py)
- **Sample Output**:
  - Input: The maze layout is provided in Reeborg’s World (e.g., Maze 1)
  - Output: Reeborg successfully reaches the goal or gets stuck (visualized in Reeborg’s World) 
- **Day 7: Hangman**
- **Description**: A text-based game where the player guesses letters to uncover a randomly chosen word, with a limited number of lives, using lists and loops.
- **File**: hangman.py
- **Sample Output**:
  - Input: Player guesses a letter (e.g., "a")
  - Output: "Current word: _a___  Lives: 6" or "You lose! The word was: apple"
